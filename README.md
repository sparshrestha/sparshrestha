## Hi, I'm [Sparsh](https://sparsh.dev)

👨🏻‍💻 Software Engineer | 🎓 Master's in AI @ Kathmandu University | 🌐 Open Source Contributor  

I build practical software with a focus on robust engineering, automation, and open collaboration. Prior to that, I spent 3 years working on mobile apps and game projects leading to 150+ million downloads worldwide.
Away from work, I spend my time as an indie hacker context switching between product-first and code-first axes.
